            This poster was made to increase awareness of the amount of plastic
            that is being wasted by humans. It was inspired by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40654915" target=" ">a BBC article</a> which 
            referred to Earth as becoming a plastic planet. This in turn inspired me to
            come up with the phrase "Planet Plastic" and create the visuals which show
            our planet's name "Planet Earth" crossed out and replaced with "Planet Plastic"
            to emphasize how much pollution there is.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the statistic at the bottom states,
            most of our plastic ends up in the environment. This plastic
            harms the plants and animals, and eventually will come back into
            our own bodies as we eat meats that come from animals that have ingested plastic
            and microplastics. Plastic has even been found <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/05/plastic-bag-mariana-trench-pollution-science-spd/"> at the bottom
            of the Mariana Trench,</a> the deepest part of the ocean. No place is safe from our
            harmful pollution and our planet will slowly die unless we act fast to change 
            our habits as a species.
