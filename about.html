    <p style="padding-top: 30px;">
        Hello, nice to meet you! I’m Anjali! I’m a graphic design student from the California Bay Area,
        attending university at San José State University!
        I am currently a Graphic Design/Illustration Intern at TA-DA! Language Productions.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have been studying design since Fall 2017.
        My interests lie across a wide variety of design topics, such as print design,
        UX/UI design, branding, and recently, web design and 3D modeling.
        I also have an interest in photography.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the side, I like to write books and create conlangs—constructed languages,
        which are created from scratch. If you’re interested in taking at look at my conlangs and conscripts
        (constructed scripts),
        check them out on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aurnisconlangs/" target=" "> my Instagram!</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        My top skills are Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, XD, and Lightroom.
        I am also experienced in AfterEffects, HTML5, CSS, and a beginner in Javascript.
        I’ve also had experience working with 3D modeling software such as Meshmixer and Blender.
        If you would like a deeper look into these skills which I learned,
        you can browse below the courses which I have taken:
