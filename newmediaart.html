        <h2>What is New Media Art?</h2>

        <p>
            New media art is a genre of art that combines various art media and technology to create
            a unique artwork. It can range from photography to film and video to light and optics to music
            and much more. It can even have a combination of any or all of these. There are three main
            artists whose work I really enjoyed within the new media art genre. Abu Ali Mustafa, Lynn
            Hershman Leeson, and Nan Goldin are three artists who capture the genre of new media art very
            well.

            The film is divided into parts. The first part shows what can be assumed to be daily life in
            Palestine, featuring scenes such as women cooking, doing the laundry, going grocery shopping,
            men sitting together and talking, or conducting business, and children playing. It shows a little
            girl writing a letter to her brother who I assumed was off fighting in a conflict. In the background
            traditional music plays throughout the video. Second part opens with a group of soldiers, with a
            patriotic song about Palestine accompanying the video. The letter the girl wrote is seen to be
            delivered to the soldier. The soldiers read their letters together while smoking cigarettes. The
            third part is titled “Genocide” and shows various nations and the groups those countries
            committed genocide against or events in which genocides happened. The video goes on to show
            various quotes of people who have said Palestine or Palestinians don’t exist, followed by scenes
            of fighter planes dropping bombs.

            Abu Ali’s film has many more parts that follow, all of which show the progression of
            conflict and the destruction it leaves behind, and the impact it has on families and communities.
            The film is unforgiving in its depiction of the war in Palestine and the crimes committed against
            the Palestinians, who all they want is to live their lives normally like others around the world. It
            is a strong claiming of identity, which is what drew me to the film so much. The film can be seen

            The next artist is Lynn Hershman Leeson. She started a work in 1973 where she began
            private performances as a fictional character called Roberta Breitmore. Roberta Breitmore was
            basically a full person with her own apartment, psychiatrist, bank account, club memberships to
            places like Weight Watchers, roommate ads, clothing, makeup, walk, handwriting, and much
            more. 144 documentations were made of this fictional person, including legal documents. At one
            point she multiplied into four other people appearing in her guise. In the end she held an
            exorcism that transformed Breitmore into the natural elements. The performance examines the
            work between indivuals’ “real” and “virtual” identities. The topic is more relevant than ever in
            today’s day and age with many people having internet identities which are different than their
            normal every day identities. It forces us to reevaluate between privacy, security, and convenience
            in a society and culture where technology plays a central role in our lives. For Leeson the project
            was an exploration of her own personal identity. In her own words she states that “[Roberta] was
            by own flipped effigy; my physical reverse, my psychological fears.” The Roberta Breitmore
            project explores the idea that identity is as much a socially constricted idea as a psychological
            one. Learn more <a href="http://www.lynnhershman.com/project/roberta-breitmore/" target=" ">here.</a>

            Lastly is an artist whose work I am already familiar with, named Nan Goldin. Goldin is a
            photographer whose work focuses heavily on identity. She works mainly in the LGBT
            communities. The work I am focusing on is called Chasing a Ghost, of which the central piece is
            called Sisters, Saints, & Sibyls. This is a new multimedia installation that focuses on women who
            are trapped in psychological and mythical contexts. It explores the suicide of Goldin’s sister,
            Barbara, alongside the history of Saint Barbara and Goldin’s own hospitalization histories. More
            generally the work explores the parallel between saints and modern rebellious women. Click <a href="https://

            Many of thew works that drew my attention were artists and projects which explored
            social turmoil or personal identity, or both. As an artist these are topics that interest me and are
            what in the future I would like to make and explore with my own art. Identity is an important
            topic for me as it is something I have struggled with my whole life, having grown up with two
            vastly different cultures side by side fighting for my attention. This includes cultural identity as
            well as national identity, as I grew up here in California but I still have strong ties to family and
            culture back in India. New media art is a genre that will help greatly to help me create artwork
            with which I can explore these themes that are important to me and help me find a way to
            connect with these parts of me that are conflicting.
